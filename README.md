Welcome to the **eighth problem** of the React 30+ Practical Problems series! In this challenge, we will implement a simple to-do list application.

### Problem 8: To-Do List Application ✅

Build a React application with a `ToDoList` component to demonstrate adding and removing tasks.

**📝 Problem Description**

Create a React application that features a `ToDoList` component. The component should allow users to:

- Add new tasks by entering text and clicking an "Add" button.
- Remove tasks by clicking a "Remove" button next to each task.
- Display the list of tasks dynamically as items are added or removed.

This challenge will help you practice working with React state and event handling.
